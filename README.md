#Assignment 2, Programming for Designers
##Instructions

This is the readme file for your second assignment.  Edit this file using markdown formatting to provide additional information for your tutor to read as they are marking your exercises. You can use [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/), which is a handy online markdown editor - just write your document and copy the markdown from there into this readmen file!

We're not looking for amazing programmer skills - we expect everyone to be just starting out in this unit.  What we do want to see is evidence that you are thinking about an engaging with the exercises and concepts they incorporate.

While the exercises you submit tell us a lot about how much you understand, this readme file can provide helpful additional insights which may boost your overall grade!

Finally, please don't submit this file with this text inside it! Neglecting to edit this file or delete this text also tells us a lot about how much you have engaged with this assignment and understand what you're doing!
